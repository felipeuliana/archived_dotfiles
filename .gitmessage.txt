# Tips:
# - <type>: feat; fix; build; chore; ci; docs; style; refactor; perf; test.
# - It's recommended to use a maximum of 50 characters for the subject and 72 for the body.
# - Use the message body to explain "why", "for what", "how" and additional details.
# - Use the message "BREAKING CHANGE:" and/or appends a "!" after the <type>[scope], when a breaking API change (MAJOR in Semantic Versioning), in commits of any type.
